  <h2>Early life and career</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Kwon Hyuk (Hangul: 권혁; born November 10, 1992), better known by his stage name Dean, is a South Korean alternative R&B singer-songwriter, rapper and record producer. He has released one solo EP, 130 Mood: TRBL, as well as multiple collaborations with both American and South Korean artists.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Kwon Hyuk was born and raised in Hongeun-dong, Seoul. He developed an interest in American hip hop and rap in middle school, and began singing in high school. At that time, he considered music as an "escape from studying," rather than an occupation. He initially wrote songs in his room, which he kept secret from his parents at first. Although he was the first musician in his family, his parents enjoyed music and supported his decision to become an artist.
  <p class="paragraph">He began his career at the age of sixteen, performing with hip-hop artist Keith Ape. By eighteen, he was writing tracks for K-pop stars, under the name 'Deanfluenza'. The name originated from actor James Dean, whose rebellious image appealed to him, and the word 'influenza', signifying his desire to make a "viral" impact on the music industry.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">At the age of twenty, he was under the tutelage of Joombas Music Group CEO and producer Hyuk Shin, employed with the songwriting team of the Los Angeles-based company whose works include EXO's "Growl" and Justin Bieber's "One Less Lonely Girl". He was credited on tracks including Exo's "Black Pearl" and VIXX's "Voodoo Doll".</p>

  <h2>2015: U.S. and South Korean debut</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Dean debuted in the United States in July 2015 with the single "I'm Not Sorry", featuring Grammy winner Eric Bellinger. This set him apart from other Korean singers who had collaborated with American artists, the vast majority of whom began their careers in Korea. FACT UK magazine's Claire Lobenfeld subsequently referred to his work with Bellinger, when listing him as an R&B artist to watch for in 2016, noting that artists like Justin Bieber and Chris Brown had also worked with Bellinger. That year, he also collaborated with Mila J on "Here & Now" and Anderson Paak on "Put My Hands on You". He debuted in South Korea in October that year, and his second single "Pour Up", featuring Block B's rapper Zico, was named Best R&B and Soul Song at the Korean Music Awards on February 29, 2016. He also collaborated with Korean hip-hop artists Zion.T, Crush, and Junggigo on the single "247", Dok2 on "I Love It", and Dynamic Duo on "How You Doin'?".</p>

  <h2>2016–present: 130 Mood : TRBL, collaboration and music producing</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">On January 8, 2016, Dean released the single "What 2 Do", featuring Crush and Filipino-American singer Jeff Bernat, On March 25, he released his first EP 130 mood : TRBL, which he wrote and produced with collaborators. The EP charted at No. 10 on the Gaon Album Chart, No. 3 on the Billboard World Albums chart, and No. 22 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, while "Bonnie & Clyde" entered Billboard's World Digital Songs chart at No. 12. The EP was well received, and was nominated for Album of the Year and Best R&B & Soul Album on Korean Hip-Hop Awards and Korean Music Awards, respectively, as well the two track on the album "D (half moon)" and "21" received multiple nomination.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">In 2016 he had several collaborations, notably featuring on Taeyeon's single "Starlight", Heize's single "Shut Up & Groove" and "And July", and a collaboration on a single and music video with Zico and Crush, named "Bermuda Triangle", which debuted on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart at No. 3, making it the highest position he had received on that chart. He also placed for the first time on two "overall popularity" charts; he and his song "D (Half Moon)" featuring Gaeko debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart and the song at No. 33 on the Billboard Twitter Top Tracks chart. On December 11, "Bermuda Triangle" won the weekly competition on the Inkigayo music show.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Also, in 2016, Dean wrote and produced for other artists and music programs, such as two tracks for Lee Hi's album Seoulite; he also created songs for Block B, Boys Republic and BASTARZ, a Block B sub-unit consisting of three members. He also appeared on the JTBC show Two Yoo Project Sugar Man as a producer, arranging a well-received version of the Mose song, "It's Love," for a performance by iKON, and "Je T'aime" performed by Winner. He prepared two tracks for a September 2 appearance as producer on the Unpretty Rapstar 3 show where contestants would use the tracks in the rap competition.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">February 17, 2017, Dean released his first solo work in eleven months, a single album Limbo, with two tracks, "Come Over" featuring Baek Ye-rin, and "The Unknown Guest". "Come Over", the title track, quickly rose to the top of several South Korean music charts. The accompanying music video was created and directed by artist Seong Lib, who had also worked with SHINee. In April, he made his first-time appearance as a producer on the hip-hop audition show Show Me the Money 6, along with fellow artist Zico, where they won the show as the winning producers. At the end of the year, he released the single "Instagram", the song topped all local music charts in South Korea</p>
